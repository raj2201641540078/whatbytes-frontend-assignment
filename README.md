## 🔴 Problem Statement

❤️ Thank you for the opportunity to work on this frontend assessment.

The goal of this project was to build a **modern, responsive e-commerce interface** where users can:

- 🛍️ Browse products  
- 🔍 Search items  
- 🎯 Apply filters  
- ➕ Add items to a cart with real-time updates  

The application is developed using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, with a focus on:

- ⚡ Clean UI & smooth user experience  
- 🧩 Reusable, component-based architecture  
- 🧠 Efficient state management using React Context API  
- 🛒 Cart functionality with quantity handling & persistence  

This assignment allowed me to demonstrate my **frontend development skills**, attention to UI details, and ability to implement interactive features in a structured and scalable manner.
